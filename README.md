# KiDrone Drone Path Planning

This is an algorithm that generates the optimal flight path for a drone over a terrain with given constrains.

## Requirements

For running the code:

* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

* [Shapely](https://pypi.org/project/shapely/)

* [pyproj](https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/index.html)

For development:

* [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.2.x/) (for unit tests)

* [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) (for type checks)

## Recommended Extensions
* [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments) (Creates more specified and better highlighted comments used throughout all the files)

* [vscode-pdf](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tomoki1207.pdf) (Enables PDF viewing in VS Code for pdf files in the repo)

* [Rainbow CSV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv) (Highlights different columns in .csv files)

## Instructions
