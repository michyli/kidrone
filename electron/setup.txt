Install node.js
(The next step resulted in the node_modules folder being created, idk if you'll need to do if it's already there?)
Go to electron directory, if doesn't work then gui directory and run "npm install", then run "npm install python-shell" 
(this should be installed alr)
There should only be one node_modules folder, one package.json, and one package-lock.json. Let me know if there are two -_-
Run "npm start" to start the app
