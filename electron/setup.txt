Install node.js
(The next step resulted in the node_modules folder being created, idk if you'll need to do if it's already there?)
Go to electron directory and run "npm install", then run "npm install python-shell"
(This creates two node_modules folders for somre reason, just combine their contents and delete the extra)
Run "npm start" to start the app
